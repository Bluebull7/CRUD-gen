# REST API to CRUD App Generator

This project aims to automate the generation of basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications directly from REST API specifications (OpenAPI / Swagger).

## Features

- **API Analysis:** Parse OpenAPI specs to extract endpoints, data models, and potential relationships.
- **TypeScript Model Generation:** Generate TypeScript interfaces representing API resources for type safety in the frontend.
- **UI Scaffolding:** Create basic React and/or Vue components (forms, lists, detail views) wired to the API.
- **Customization (Planned):** Allow users to adjust generated UI and model behavior.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Provide an OpenAPI spec: (Place your spec file in the project)
3. Run the generator: #(add the command to run your tool once developed)
